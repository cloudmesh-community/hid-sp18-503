\begin{abstract}
Openstack is one of the most important cloud coputing Infrastructure
as a Service that allows users to setup and manage servers easily. It
provides APIs that help users to manage these services through
command-line and through code. The NIST Big Data Reference 
Architecture defines a reference architecture for various objects that
are important in the context of cloud computing. In this project we
aim to build a REST service using these object specifications that
help users complete an openstack deployment easily.

\section{Introduction}
Openstack is a free and open source cloud Infrastructure as a Service
that allows users to set up resources such as virtual servers for
their customers. It is one of the most widely deployed cloud
infrastructure and is constantly improving. It provides an openstack
python software development toolkit (sdk) that contains python APIs
for openstack services along with command line tools that allow users
to write python code to remotely perform actions on the openstack
cloud

Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural standard
for web applications that allows different applications to comunicate
easily. It allows separation of clients and servers and the server
funcionality can be esily changed without affecting the client's
interface to the server. REST is highly scalable and easy to
extend~\cite{hid-sp18-503-REST}. The NIST Big Data Reference
Architecture defines standard properties for objects that that are
important to Big Data echosystem.
%~\cite{}.
These objects can be easily accessed or transferred with the use of
RESTful Applications that use REST verbs (GET, PUT, POST, UPDATE,
DELETE) to manipulate these objects~\cite{hid-sp18-503-REST}.

%\cite{}
We aim to develop a REST service with the help of Swagger - a tool
that converts a yml specification to code - that can be used by other
applications to setup and manage Virtual Machines on openstack.

Doing this requires identification of various objects that are needed
to accomplish such a task. Some of these are images, servers,
keypairs, networks, and subnets. Each of these objects should be
accessible from the REST application, so that they can be updated and
stored as necessary.

\section{Openstack Services}
Openstack consists of various services that are responsible for
different operations. Each of htese services are important from a
users viewpoit and are described below:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Keystone}: Keystone is the identity management system for
openstack. It is this service that generates authentication tokens a and
identifies users with the help of passwords and provides the need for
users to identify themselvs in their applications. Keystone can be
integrated with third party services such as Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP)

\item \textbf{Nova}: Nova is the compute service from Openstack, and is
responsible for the management, creation and deletion of virtual machines.
Nova allows administrators to choose the hypervisor of their choice while
providing a common API to manage VMs

\item \textbf{Glance}: The service responsible for managing and cataloging
images that are uploaded by the users.

\item \textbf{Neutron}: Neutron is a networking service provided by openstack.
It is responsible for creating networks between VMs and for ensuring various
network services available to the user.

\item \textbf{Cinder}: Cinder is the service responsible for managing the
external storage including external volumes and Network File storage (NFS).
It allows vendors to create specialized plucins for their devices.

\item \textbf{Heat}: Heat is the cloud orchestration layer on opestack. It
is responsible for providing Floating IPs, managing security groups, servers
and many other services.

\item \textbf{Horizon}: Horizon is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) dashboard
that allows users to conect to openstack and manage their cloud using their
web browsers. 

Openstack provides differnet clients for each of these services that
can be installed individually as needed. They provide a common unified
API with the help of the openstack SDK that allows users to access
most of thse sevices. Some of the services do not have complete
functionality in the openstack SDK, which will be included in the near
future

\section{Object Definitions}
The objects that are used in this project are inspired by the objects defined in the Nist Big Data Reference Architecture NIST (BDRA) document and are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Image}: An Image defines what types of operating systems are
availabe to be used to create a virtual machine on openstack. Each of
the images can have different minimum requirements that are needed to
install the operating system and they must be included in the
object. The minimal image object that was used for the project is
shown in the appendix

\item \textbf{Keypair}: A keypair defines a set of RSA keys that are
generated by openstack to allow usere to correctly identify themselves
and to log into the servers. It has two parts, a public key and a
provate key and is identified with the help of a user defined
name. The minimal object for an image is shown in the appendix.

\item \textbf{Flavor}: Flavors identify the different types of hadrdware
available to the openstack users. A user can select a flavor based on
their needs and the requirements o the image. The flavors include in
their definition the RAM size, disk size, the number of virtual CPUs
and the available swap memory, and are identified using a unique ID
and a name.  A minimal definition of the flavor object is shown in the
appendix

\item \textbf{Server}: A server is another name for a Virtual Machine
running on the openstack cloud. To define a server we must define the
name of the server, the flavor and the image to be used, the secirity
groups and networks that are needed for the server and a keypair that
will be used to connect to the server in the future, along with a
floating IP address. A minimal definition of the server used in the
project is shown in the appendix.

\item \textbf{Networks}: Openstack allows users to set up their own
networks for their virtual machines, and alows them to create new VMs
that use these networks. Networks can be internal or external and can
have subnets created by the user. A minimal definition of the network
object is given in the appendix.

\item \textbf{Subnet}: Subnets allow users to identify and separate
different parts of their openstack networks. A subnet object should
contain a list of DNS servers and shoud identify whether it has a DHCP
server or not.  A minimal definition of the subnet oject is given in
the appendix.

%% \item define approach and objects used used for the project
%%       and the object specification used IN VERBATIM 2 pages
%% \item describe the problems faced in the approach
%% \item describe openstack container management ?
%% \item install and try the container management from REST API ?
%% \item add images etc of how it works
%% \item add verbatim code for object definition
